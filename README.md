## Sensay Robot
### This is the code section from the Tsinghua &UC Berkeley Retreat 2024, where we were honored with the second prize. 

In this project, we designed a robot powered by a large language model, enabling it to effectively communicate with customers and assist them. We have modified the code to integrate with ChatGPT-4, so you can directly use it with your own robot.
